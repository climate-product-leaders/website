#### CHAPTER 2
# Build Sustainable AI Products

<div class="intro-chapter" style="text-align:left;"> 
  <p>Sustainable AI product design means using AI only where it truly adds value while keeping emissions, energy use, and waste to a minimum. Amidst today’s AI hyper-abundance and easier feature deployment, product managers play a key role in making smart, intentional choices. This chapter helps you assess whether AI is the right fit, reduce the impact of your data and models, and embed sustainability into your AI product development—without compromising performance, user trust and value, or business goals.</p>
