# Case Study: Brussels Environment

## Context/Challenge

Brussels Environment aimed to enhance the environmental sustainability of its digital presence by implementing ecodesign principles during a revamp of its main website. This initiative was part of a broader Sustainable IT strategy to integrate environmental and social considerations across their IT infrastructure and operations. This is one of several initiatives that has enabled Brussels Environment to achieve the highest level of sustainable technology classification in Belgium (the 'Label NR' certification). They are the first public organisation in Belgium to achieve this, promoting sustainable IT practices in the regional ecosystem.

## Objective/KPIs/Goals:

- **Objective:** Implement ecodesign principles to reduce the environmental footprint of digital operations, specifically through the website revamp project.
- **KPIs**: Measured through various indicators including page size, load time, number of requests, transferred bytes, DOM size, and eco-scores (Greenspector, Kastor.green, Ecoindex).

## Approach/Tactic

- Engaged an ecodesign expert to review graphical designs and provide ongoing guidance during development sprints.
- Implemented monitoring tools to track improvements in website performance and environmental impact.
- Conducted before-and-after assessments on 30 representative pages to measure effectiveness.
- Integrated UX/UI agency feedback and optimized designs for both ecodesign and user experience objectives.
- Used Greenspector for website eco-score assessment.
- Applied WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines and had a small DEV audit done by third party experts in A11Y

## Results/Impact

- **Customer Experience/UX**: Improved UX initially, though some challenges arose post-implementation due to applied ecodesign practices.
- **Costs/Overhead**: Increased project costs and timeline due to expert consultation and design adjustments.
- **Performance**: Significant improvements in metrics per page:
    - Average carbon impact: Reduced from 1.36 g eqCO2 to 0.25 g eqCO2.
    - Average transferred data: Reduced from 4.7 MB to 1.13 MB.
    - Average HTTP requests per page: Reduced from 59 to 38.
    - Improved [Greenspector eco-score](https://greenspector.com/en/how-is-the-ecoscore-calculated-in-the-case-of-a-web-or-mobile-benchmark/#:~:text=Whether%20it's%20for%20the%20web,Mobile%20Data%2C%20Performance%20and%20Energy.) from 64 to 79. For comparison, the average [Greenspector eco-score](https://greenspector.com/en/how-is-the-ecoscore-calculated-in-the-case-of-a-web-or-mobile-benchmark/#:~:text=Whether%20it's%20for%20the%20web,Mobile%20Data%2C%20Performance%20and%20Energy.) for French institutional websites is 52.84.
    - Reduced environmental footprint in terms of carbon emissions, water resources, and land use.
- **Internal Team Impact**: Enhanced knowledge and interest in ecodesign and sustainable IT practices. Positive impact on company culture and employee motivation.
- **Decision-Making**: Efforts to integrate sustainable IT guidelines into all new digital projects and foster collaboration within the regional ecosystem.
- **Monitoring:** While the initial redesign showed significant improvement, it has been challenging to maintain continuous monitoring. The team has recently set up instrumentation using Lighthouse to keep track.
- **External levers:** Brussels Environment integrates Sustainable IT into regional policies and actively engages in awareness-raising and experience sharing, including "[Digital Collage](https://digitalcollage.org/)" workshops and participation in events.

## Next Steps

- Develop an action plan for systematizing ecodesign practices across all digital initiatives as part of a digital sobriety policy.
- Integrate post-launch monitoring and maintenance into the project lifecycle.
- Define clear roles and interactions among external suppliers from project inception to improve collaboration and outcomes.
- Brussels Environment have other pilot projects in ecodesign, including the environmental permit application ([MyPermit.Environnement](https://mypermit.environnement.brussels/home)). They also have projects related to green spaces in Brussels, such as the [Brussels Gardens](https://gardens.brussels/fr) tool, which uses the "kastor.green" measurement tool.

## Lessons Learned and Advice

- **Lessons Learned**: Start integrating ecodesign principles early in project planning to manage costs and expectations effectively.
- **Advice**: Emphasize change management and awareness-building within project teams to ensure understanding and commitment to ecodesign goals. Consider external expert support for initial projects to accelerate learning and adoption.

## Conclusion

This case study highlights Brussels Environmentâ€™s proactive approach to integrating ecodesign principles into digital projects. They are committed to environmental and social sustainability and serve as a leader in sustainable IT practices within Belgium, as demonstrated by their high level of the 'Label NR' certification. The organization continues to develop and implement sustainable IT practices, working with both internal and external partners.
