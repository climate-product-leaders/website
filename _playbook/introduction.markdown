# Acknowledgments

We couldn't have started this playbook, let alone finish writing it, without the support of some amazing people we met in our respective climate journey and the climate community at large.

A big thank you to our amazing reviewers who provided thoughtful feedback and challenged us to improve every bit of this playbook. We’re forever grateful for your time and dedication to bringing the best climate practices for product managers and fostering climate action further
