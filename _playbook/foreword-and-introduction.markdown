  <h1>Foreword</h1>

  <p><b>It is clear that, as a whole, private sector action is not meeting the scale or severity of the climate crisis.</b></p>
  
  <p>Companies must redefine what they believe to be ambitious climate action and change how they do business to align with a healthy climate for the planet and all people. And while businesses may seem like unmovable entities driven by profit, we often forget one key detail: they are made up of people. They consist of employees like you and me, each with a unique set of passions, skills, and knowledge.</p> 
  
  <p>Because employees are what keep businesses running, they have immense power to create change—indeed, they are some of the most critical drivers of elevated corporate climate action. But for too long, climate action has been siloed in under-resourced sustainability teams. How can we expect just one small team within a company (if there even is one) to engage all corners of an organization? Thankfully, non-sustainability employees are waking up to the fact that they, too, can use their positions for climate action. Every job is becoming a climate job.</p>

  <p>Product managers are especially well poised to use their roles to accelerate climate action in the workplace. Weaving together business, technology, and user experience—and interacting with various stakeholders along the way—product managers can be effective and far-reaching climate communicators. With a bird’s eye view of the product journey, employees in these roles have multiple opportunities to integrate and elevate climate considerations to the same status as product usability, feasibility, and profitability. And, perhaps most importantly, product managers not only influence internal product processes and decisions, but their efforts to integrate climate can shift user behavior and have external ripple effects that extend far beyond their organization.</p>

  <p>Product managers work with some of the most strategic levers for ensuring climate is a central part of business decisions—using their existing position and expertise, they can support their companies in becoming climate champions. In this playbook, you will learn that to be a product leader is to also be a climate leader.</p>

# Introduction

### Digital Is Physical

The digital revolution, while transformative, carries a profound
environmental footprint. It is estimated that the Information and
Communications Technology (ICT) sector alone accounts for
approximately [3.7% of global greenhouse gas emissions](https://www.greenit.fr/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GREENIT_EENM_etude_EN_accessible.pdf)—a figure larger
than the entire aviation industry and equivalent to road freight. With
projections suggesting that this number may reach [up to 14% by 2040](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095965261733233X),
the consequences for our climate and biodiversity cannot be overstated.

This playbook seeks to illuminate the often-overlooked fact that
the digital world is indeed physical: tethered to the environment in a
multitude of ways. Every byte of data, every online transaction, and every
digital innovation leaves a mark on our planet. It's crucial to recognize
that the servers, data centers, end-user devices, and vast infrastructure
enabling our digital experiences are grounded in physical reality,
consuming environmental resources and energy.

### Contribution To Global Warming

Given that manufacturing or production accounts for 57% of greenhouse
gas emissions related to digital and the internet, we need to take all
possible measures to lower manufacturing demand. This can be achieved
by reducing the number of connected objects and flat screens, as well as
increasing the lifespan of equipment.

On the other hand, usage or operation represents 43% of digital emissions.
To address this, it is important to build low-carbon and sustainable digital
services and products.

### Corporate Responsibility And Consumer Expectations

Organizations across the globe, from Tech to Financial Services,
should care deeply about this impact, not only because of the ethical
imperative to safeguard our planet but because consumers, stakeholders,
and regulators are increasingly expecting and demanding sustainable
practices (see [REEN Law in France](https://www.fruggr.io/blog/the-french-reen-law-mitigating-the-environmental-footprint-of-corporate-digital-technologies), [Web Sustainability Guidelines (WSG)
1.0](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/) or [European Green Deal](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en)). Today, software products are interwoven with
our daily lives and are integral to nearly every industry. Consequently,
product management stands at the crossroads of determining how this
digital future unfolds.

### The Strategic Role Of Product Managers

Product managers, as the strategists guiding product direction,
have a unique opportunity and responsibility. They have the power to
influence design, consumption, and the overall life cycle of products,
they actively collaborate with all departments and tie the strategy to
the execution. They can drive innovation that not only meets user &
business needs but does so in an ecologically conscious manner. Their
decisions can pivot organizations towards a path that values
functionality and sustainability.

### Business Benefits of Sustainable Practices

Adopting a sustainable approach to digital product
management offers a host of compelling advantages that reach far
beyond the obvious environmental benefits. In the realm of business
operations, weaving sustainability into your organizational strategy
can create a unified vision that enhances collaboration across
departments. This focus also aligns closely with the values of an
increasingly eco-conscious workforce, which in turn boosts
employee satisfaction and retention rates.

Sustainability can also drive innovation and differentiate yourself
from the competition. It can drive higher customer attraction and
retention, which could lead to greater marketing and PR value.

### Sustainability As A Performance Enhancer

From the viewpoint of product development, sustainability
is more than just a buzzword. It's a performance enhancer.
By optimizing resources and reducing waste, you not only decrease
your carbon footprint but also speed up development cycles, reduce
infrastructure costs, and improve security and resilience.

A well-optimized, eco-friendly product is generally leaner and faster,
resulting in improved SEO, enhanced user experience, and increased
conversion and click-through rates. Customers will appreciate and
reward with loyalty. Ultimately, it will make your experience more
accessible and inclusive, broadening your target audience and
improving your social performance as a business.

### The Urgency Of Climate Action

As we stand on the [brink of irreversible climate change](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/),
product managers must acknowledge and champion their role in
transitioning the world towards a nature-positive economy.

This playbook lists 33 best practices to equip product
managers with the knowledge and strategies to make this transition
seamless and impactful. It is intended to be a work companion and a
guide to help you make better decisions regardless of your past
experience in product management. By embracing the principles in
this playbook, we can ensure that our digital advancements support
sustainable development while remaining competitive and serving
our users better.
