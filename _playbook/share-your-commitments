matter: |
  Publicly sharing your organization's commitment to environmental sustainability fosters transparency, builds stakeholder trust, and amplifies impact by inspiring others. It demonstrates corporate responsibility, responding to increasing consumer and investor demand for companies prioritizing the planet and profit. As a product leader, you should publicly promote actions your organization takes from this document.
do: |
  - Collaborate with your marketing department and highlight the benefits of being open about your commitment to sustainability (in the product, in social media, to your investors and your community at large)
  - Work with your supply chain to align your goals for environmental sustainability and provide [supplier standards of practice](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/guidelines/5-16-create-a-supplier-standards-of-practice/)
  - Clearly outline the organization's environmental goals and values with near term goals (ideally yearly goals)
  - Work with relevant stakeholders to try to align with the Paris Agreement: 50% emissions reduction by 2030, (on [all three scopes](https://ghgprotocol.org/blog/you-too-can-master-value-chain-emissions)) then net-zero by 2050; Focus on cutting emissions by 90% first, then [remove or offset the remaining 10%](https://www.shopify.com/climate/buy-carbon-removal)
  - Don‚Äôt overstate your commitment or claim that you already are carbon-neutral or [net-zero](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/net-zero) (even if it is your objective, to reduce the risk of greenwashing)
  - Try to be transparent and open about unknowns, blockers, and challenges
  - Publish periodic progress reports on environmental initiatives (not only ESG reports)
  - Use blogs, podcasts, meetups or webinars to discuss sustainability efforts
  - Create spaces for open dialogue with stakeholders about environmental challenges and solutions
  - Highlight quantifiable changes and milestones achieved
  - Obtain sustainable digital or IT labels such as the [Sustainable IT label](https://label-nr.fr/en/how-does-it-work/)
  - Share insights with your users to help them monitor their impact
  - Share your offset and removal strategy; offsetting carbon emissions can be a controversial topic.

  We invite you to explore the training programs offered by the [Green Software Foundation](https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/) (recommended for engineers) and [Product for Net Zero](https://productfornetzero.com/) (recommended for designers, product managers, and strategists). If you're unsure where to find experts or companies that can provide talks or training, there are several online groups and communities that can guide you in the right direction. Consider joining MCJ, ClimateAction.tech, [Terra.do](http://Terra.do) or Work On Climate, among others.
  Don‚Äôt forget to engage with the Human Resources and Culture department. They will be instrumental in effectively raising awareness within your organization and creating momentum. We recommend covering various topics for all job functions and asking for feedback to tailor the content and approach. This will help you stay in tune with what people need to improve and have a greater climate impact. Shifting the culture doesn‚Äôt happen overnight, but it can be an exciting journey.
